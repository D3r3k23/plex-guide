### HDR

High Dynamic Range (HDR) video enhances the visual experience by expanding the range of contrast and color that a video can display, resulting in more lifelike and vibrant images.
* HDR extends the contrast range between the darkest and brightest parts of an image or a video clip. This means that shadows have more detail, and highlights are brighter and more realistic. This heightened contrast leads to a more immersive viewing experience.
* HDR content can display a wider range of colors compared to standard dynamic range (SDR) video. This wider color gamut means that you see more accurate and vibrant colors, providing a more true-to-life visual experience.
