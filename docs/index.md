This guide contains all of the information you need when using my Plex server. The content herein should answer 99% of your questions, though you're always welcome to ask me directly. While this guide primarily shows screenshots from a web browser, you can make these changes from any Plex app (mobile, smart TV, or game console).

I recommend switching to a web browser to make the changes. All settings in this guide will sync across your devices and only need to be configured once, with one important exception: Plex streaming quality must be set separately the first time you log into each new Plex application.

If you're new to the server, please read through the [Setup](setup/what-is-plex.md) section to learn how to use the server.
