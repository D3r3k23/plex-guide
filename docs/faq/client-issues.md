# Client Issues

When you're troubleshooting an issue, the first step is, as always:

### 1. Turn it off and turn it back on again

Close and restart the Plex app on your device. If you're using a TV, you can also try restarting the network connection, or restarting the entire TV.

### 2. Search the documentation

Check these sources to find information about your problem:

- [PLEXplainers](https://www.plxplainers.xyz)<br>
- [Plex Reference](https://support.plex.tv/articles/categories/player-apps-platforms)<br>
- [Media Clients Wiki](https://mediaclients.wiki/Plex)<br>

### 3. Contact @D3r3k

We prefer that you contact D3r3k in the server Discord channel.
