!!! quote "Is Plex safe to use?"

    Yes, connecting to and using my Plex server is completely safe. Your connection is protected by the same type of security that banks use for online banking. All of your personal information - including your username, what you watch, and your viewing history - is only visible to you and me, and other server users, if you choose.
