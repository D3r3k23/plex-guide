# I requested something an hour ago but it hasn't shown up yet.

When requesting content at [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }}), you'll see three important dates:

![Overseerr Release Dates](../assets/images/jellyseerr-release-dates.webp){ width="320" }

Release dates within {{ vars.request_url }}
///

1. Theatrical Release - When it hits theaters
2. Digital Release - When it's available to stream/purchase digitally
3. Physical Release - When DVDs/Blu-rays are available

!!! important
    Content typically won't be available on Plex until after its Digital Release date. When requesting new content, always check the Digital Release date in Overseerr's "Release Dates" column to know when it will be available.

There are rare exceptions to this rule, but generally, if your requested content isn't showing up in Plex, verify that its Digital Release date has passed.
