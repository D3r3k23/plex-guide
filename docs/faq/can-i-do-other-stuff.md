# Can I listen to music/podcasts, store photos, or do other stuff?

Yes, contact D3r3k for more information. [Audiobookshel](https://www.audiobookshelf.org) is available for *podcasts* and *audiobooks*. You can also use [Immich](https://immich.app) to store your photos. It's a custom made version of Google Photos.

Support for music is coming soon.
