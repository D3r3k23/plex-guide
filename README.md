# Plex Documentation Guide

A standardized documentation template for your Plex server, built with Material for MkDocs and deployed via GitHub Pages. This template includes pre-built pages covering common Plex topics like streaming quality, content requests, transcoding, and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow each step carefully, missing any step will prevent your site from working. The setup process requires both GitHub Actions for automated builds and GitHub Pages for deploying the hosted pages. Github Actions in particular is disabled by default when forking a repo.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Enable GitHub Actions:
   - Go to Actions tab (top of this page)
   - Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
3. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings (top of this page) > Pages
   - Set "Source" to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch and "/" (root) folder
   - Click Save

Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/mkdocs-plex-guide-template`

The template will automatically use your GitHub username and repository name throughout the site. You can see this in action at my demo site: https://mistercalvin.github.io/mkdocs-plex-guide-template

### Automatic Deployment
The site is automatically built using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. After a successful build, the site is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages then serves automatically. You can monitor the build and deployment process in the Actions tab of your repository.

## üìù Customization

### Basic Configuration
The following values are automatically set via environment variables in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml):
- `username` - Your GitHub username (lowercase)
- `repo_name` - Repository name
- `year` - Current year

These values are used for the header / footer within MKDocs.

### Content Customization
Key files to modify:
- `docs/*.md` - Documentation pages
- `docs/stylesheets/extra.css` - [Custom admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#custom-admonitions)
- `docs/assets/` - Images and video

### Default Values
You can customize default values for:
- request_url: `request.example.com`
- plex_url: `plex.example.com`
- plex_libraries: `Movies and TV Shows`
- noreply_email: `noreply@example.com`

Edit these in [`main.py`](main.py) in the project root. These values are used throughout the rendered markdown pages.
