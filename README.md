# Plex Documentation Guide

A standardized documentation template for your Plex server, built with Material for MkDocs and deployed via GitHub Pages. This template includes pre-built pages covering common Plex topics like streaming quality, content requests, transcoding, and more.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Enable GitHub Actions:
   - Go to Actions tab (top of this page)
   - Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
3. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings (top of this page) > Pages
   - Set "Source" to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch and "/" (root) folder
   - Click Save

Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/mkdocs-plex-guide-template`

The template will automatically use your GitHub username and repository name throughout the site. You can see this in action at my demo site: https://mistercalvin.github.io/mkdocs-plex-guide-template

### Automatic Deployment
The site is automatically built using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. After a successful build, the site is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages then serves automatically. You can monitor the build and deployment process in the Actions tab of your repository.

## üìù Customization

### Basic Configuration
The following values are automatically set via environment variables in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml):
- `username` - Your GitHub username (lowercase)
- `repo_name` - Repository name
- `year` - Current year

These values are used for the header / footer within MKDocs.

### Content Customization
Key files to modify:
- `docs/*.md` - Documentation pages
- `docs/stylesheets/extra.css` - [Custom admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#custom-admonitions)
- `docs/assets/` - Images and video

### Default Values
You can customize default values for:
- request_url: `request.example.com`
- plex_url: `plex.example.com`
- plex_libraries: `Movies and TV Shows`
- noreply_email: `example.com`

Edit these in [`main.py`](main.py) in the project root. These values are used throughout the rendered markdown pages.
